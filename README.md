# -P4-Networking-Reflector-Repeater-L2-Forwarding-ECMP-Routing
Developed P4 programs to implement packet reflection, repetition using conditional logic and match-action tables, basic L2 forwarding, and Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. Configured switches using command-line interface to achieve efficient packet forwarding across multiple paths.
